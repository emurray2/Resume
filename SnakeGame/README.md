This game is a snake game, but instead of regular snake the goal is to guide the snake into the
box to increase the number in the center of the screen which is the score. The interactivity is
included with audio input as the control system. The user’s microphone will capture both
dynamic level and pitch values and map both of these to the snake’s speed and direction
respectively.
The user’s goal is to explore the game (i.e. wanderer personality) and figure out the score goes
up when the snake touches the box. Then the user will also need to learn how to control the
snake by seeing how the snake moves on its own based on sounds in the user’s environment.
For example, maybe when a friend is talking in the background, they’ll notice the snake’s
direction following the intonation of said person’s voice. They may also notice this too when they
speak into the microphone themselves.
