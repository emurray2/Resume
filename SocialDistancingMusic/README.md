# Fundamentals of Musicianship IV (Georgia Tech MUSI 2013) project

- Demo: []()

For my “social distancing,” Études, I decided to go with an electronic approach and use a synthesizer patch in Ableton. However, I came up with some unique ideas for controlling the synthesizer--related to social distancing. The first ideas I used were using the Ultrasonic Sensor to control the send level to a track with Convolution Reverb on it to make the sound further away. Another sensor I used to control the timbre of the synthesizer was the flex sensor.
 
Some challenges I encountered during this project happened when I came up with a last-minute idea to incorporate the internet and media into my project. I decided to do this because everyone seems to be spending much more time online since the pandemic hit, and I was curious how this online environment would contribute to my Étude. For the Arrangement View track, I used NodeJS inside my Max Patch in order to grab data from the Google Trends API on recent trending stories. The challenging thing was parsing this data in a creative way--the tone-row.

Once I overcame this challenge, It was rewarding because I was able to see this software interact with the outside world in a way I had never seen it before. This was all from the comfort of my own apartment. I discovered how powerful the internet could be in providing resources for musical inspiration while in the midst of a pandemic.
