# Chord Detection

[Results/Code](ChordDetection.ipynb)

- Demo: []()

A project group project I contributed to for Audio Content Analysis (MUSI 6201) at Georgia Tech. Our goal was to be able to detect musical chords being played on a piano through Music Information Retreival (MIR) techniques, such as feature extraction.

I contributed by adding the `get_chord_score` function, which describes an accuracy which the algorithm performed with respect to the ground truth.

I also helped with the `find_pitch_3` and `gen_chromagram` functions which use the chromagram feature extraction to detect the notes being played.
